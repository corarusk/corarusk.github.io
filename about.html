          <p>My path to a career in UX design has been all but a direct flight. It took many meaningful pit stops and flight changes to get where I am today. Nonetheless, I’m thankful because those “layovers” have molded me to be the person I am today. And who
            <span class="iAm"> am I?</span>

            <span class="iAm">I am </span>Cora Rusk. A passionate go-getter. Someone driven by the need to understand people and solve their everyday problems. Selfless and willing to take risks.

      <h2 class="aboutTitle">My Story.</h2>
      <div class="aboutUnderline"></div>
      <div class="sectionFirst">
        <p><span class="label">At the age of 9, </span>I got my first babysitting gig. Fast forward 3 years and I am the hottest commodity in the babysitting world. I even obtained a Red Cross Babysitting Certification. I take my work seriously, okay? On my off time, I was either rearranging my bedroom or transforming my MySpace profile about every other week. Little did I know, this was the beginning of my love for design and tech.</p>
      <!-- divider inside section -->

     </div>

     <div class="subSection">
         <p><span class="label">COLLEGE.</span> Right off the bat, I knew I wanted to be a teacher. You get an entire classroom to decorate? Choose a new color scheme every year? Summers off? Oh, and did I mention that I really love kids? Seems like the perfect fit… right?</p>
         <br><br>
         <p><span class="label">TWO YEARS INTO MY TEACHING CAREER.</span> I’m established, successful, but feeling… Eh.</p>
         <div class="indent">
           <p>Eh (Adjective) Of bad quality.<br>My french fries were eh.</p>
         </div>
        <p>That’s exactly how I was feeling about my career. Sure, I like education. Actually, I love education. Was I good at it? Sure. But a passion inside of me wasn’t being fueled the way I know it could be. I had a dream and drive to be a part of something bigger. I had no idea what that was. Heck, the only thing I’ve ever been my whole life was a teacher. Could I even be anything else?</p>

     <div class="subSection">
         <p><span class="label">the source of my epiphany.</span>  My husband. A technical recruiter specializing in senior level engineering roles, had a new type of position to fill. Something called a UX Designer? What’s that? As he was learning about the role of a UX designer, he felt that every bullet point he went over screamed:</p>
         <div class="indent">
           <p>"CORA WOULD BE SO GOOD AT THIS!"</p>
         </div>
        <p><span class="label">TL;DR -</span> an ample amount of YouTube and Blog binging helped me discover the field of design. The more I learned, the more I loved.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>I am so certain about this career change and so certain that UX would become a part of my identity. So, what does any rational dream-chaser do? I quit my full-time job as a teacher and enrolled in Bloc’s UX Design Apprenticeship program. In other words, I made the best decision of my life.</p>

  <!-- Conclusion -->
  <div class="lastAboutSection">
    <h4>a career change is hard work.</h4>
    <div class="aboutUnderline"></div>
    <br><br>
    <p>It takes discipline, especially being self-paced and online. Through the program and guidance from my mentor, Becky Olsen, I learned how to reposition my previously acquired skills and channel them to produce user centered products. UX design encompasses all of my passions in one - and when I am passionate about something, I put my whole heart into it.
    <br><br>Design isn't just surface level. Design isn't just a pretty face. It is a real solution to someone’s real problem. It’s a part of who <span class="iAm">I am. </span></p>
