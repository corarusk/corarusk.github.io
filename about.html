          <p>My path to a career in UX design has been all but a direct flight. It took many meaningful pit stops and flight changes to get where I am today. Nonetheless, I’m thankful because those “layovers” have molded me to be the person I am today. And who

    <!-- My Story -->

        <h3>AT THE AGE OF 9,</h3><p> I got my first babysitting gig. Fast forward 3 years and I am the hottest commodity in the babysitting world. I even obtained a Red Cross Babysitting Certification. I take my work seriously, okay? On my off time, I was either rearranging my bedroom or transforming my MySpace profile about every other week. Little did I know, this was the beginning of my love for design and tech.</p>

        <h3>COLLEGE.</h3><p> Right off the bat, I knew I wanted to be a teacher. You get an entire classroom to decorate? Choose a new color scheme every year? Summers off? Oh, and did I mention that I really love kids? Seems like the perfect fit… right?</p>

        <h3>TWO YEARS INTO MY TEACHING CAREER.</h3><p> I’m established, successful, but feeling… Eh.<br>
          <br>Eh (Adjective) Of bad quality.<br>My french fries were eh.<br>
          <br>That’s exactly how I was feeling about my career. Sure, I like education. Actually, I love education. Was I good at it? Sure. But a passion inside of me wasn’t being fueled the way I know it could be. I had a dream and drive to be a part of something bigger. I had no idea what that was. Heck, the only thing I’ve ever been my whole life was a teacher. Could I even be anything else?</p>

        <h3>THE SOURCE OF MY EPIPHANY.</h3><p> My husband. A technical recruiter specializing in senior level engineering roles, had a new type of position to fill. Something called a UX Designer? What’s that? As he was learning about the role of a UX designer, he felt that every bullet point he went over screamed:</p>
          <h4>"CORA WOULD BE SO GOOD AT THIS!"</h4>

        <h3>TL;DR</h3><p>an ample amount of YouTube and Blog binging helped me discover the field of design. The more I learned, the more I loved.<br>I am so certain about this career change and so certain that UX would become a part of my identity. So, what does any rational dream-chaser do? I quit my full-time job as a teacher and enrolled in Bloc’s UX Design Apprenticeship program. In other words, I made the best decision of my life.</p>

      <p>It takes discipline, especially being self-paced and online. Through the program and guidance from my mentor, Becky Olsen, I learned how to reposition my previously acquired skills and channel them to produce user centered products.
