          <h3>TEACHER SHORTAGE</h3>
          <p>Why are teachers leaving the profession?<br>Often, teachers are left feeling overloaded, overwhelmed, and defeated due to limited planning time and lack of resources provided by schools. Teachers are in desperate need of a consistent and reliable resource that is quality-focused and easily accessible to help them get their job done well.</p>

          <h3>IDENTIFYING A PROBLEM</h3>
          <p>A cloud storage and collaboration tool would most benefit a working professional or student, so I decided to look there first. Which professions have a low success or satisfaction rate? I quickly realized a widespread pattern of unhappiness amongst teachers. Teacher shortage is a massive problem and isn’t going away anytime soon.<br> Bingo. A target audience was born.</p>

          <h2 class="keyTakeaways">Key Takeaways</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>The age of school-issued textbooks is long gone. Teachers don’t tend to use them because the content is normally very outdated, don’t appeal to students’ interests, or align with the state standards.</li>
            <li>Teachers are given a small amount of time to plan during the day. Most teachers claim that their planning block is usually overridden by parent conferences, student make-up work, and other school-related meetings. Without planning time, teachers struggle to collaborate with their team and are left to complete tasks alone.</li>

          <h2>User Stories</h2>
          <h3>DEFINING THE SCOPE</h3>
          <p>Research detailed thus far has helped me better understand the user’s needs and create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). I then broke the MVP down into 4 epics and disassembled each epic to create User Stories. These were used to prioritize tasks in regards to the needs of the users and create a reference throughout the project to ensure a consistent scope.</p>

          <h3>MVP</h3>
          <p>Teachers want to browse and save quality, ready-to-use materials AND collaborate with teammates to complete tasks involved in the lesson planning process.</p>

          <h3>HIGH PRIORITY TASKS</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Browse content by subject & grade level</li>
            <li>Search for content</li>
            <li>Quickly save content into a folder</li>
            <li>Create a file or folder</li>
            <li>Share content with a 1+ people</li>
            <li>Edit a file saved from the web</li>
            <li>Edit an existing file</li>
            <li>Access team to-do list</li>

          <i class="fa fa-sitemap" aria-hidden="true"></i>
          <h2>Flows & Sitemap</h2>
          <p>Flow diagrams for each high priority task were created to demonstrate how the user will navigate through various pages: Landing, Onboarding, and Home. First sketching, then degital. These flows are crucial to identifying key actions within the app and which screens to focus on first.  At this stage, they’re far from set and stone, but lay a solid foundation.</p>
          <img src="images/flows.png" alt="User flows">

          <p>I then used the research data, user stories, and user flows to create a sitemap in order to organize each destination in the user flows. The sitemap was used as an outline to create the content strategy, which helped me focus on clarity and lay down a solid foundational structure of the project before moving forward.</p>

          <h2>Wireframes</h2>
          <h3>LOW FIDELITY</h3>
          <p>With now a clear focus and solid foundation, I began sketching out pages within the user flows in low fidelity. I always start with pencil and a sketchpad to allow for rapid iterations of wireframes.</p>

          <h3>HIGH FIDELITY</h3>
          <p>After tweaking and adjusting, I brought the wireframes to life in Figma by creating high fidelity digital versions of the wireframes for testing purposes in order to identify if there are any complications with the UX.</p>
