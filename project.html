          </h2>
          <h3>DEFINING THE SCOPE</h3>
          <p>Research detailed thus far has helped me better understand the user’s needs and create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). I then broke the MVP down into 4 epics and disassembled each epic to create User Stories. These were used to prioritize tasks in regards to the needs of the users and create a reference throughout the project to ensure a consistent scope.</p>

          <h3>MVP</h3>
          <p>Teachers want to browse and save quality, ready-to-use materials AND collaborate with teammates to complete tasks involved in the lesson planning process.</p>

          <h3>HIGH PRIORITY TASKS</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Browse content by subject & grade level</li>
            <li>Search for content</li>
            <li>Quickly save content into a folder</li>
            <li>Create a file or folder</li>
            <li>Share content with a 1+ people</li>
            <li>Edit a file saved from the web</li>
            <li>Edit an existing file</li>
            <li>Access team to-do list</li>

            <span class="underline">Flows & Sitemap</span>
          </h2>
          <p>Flow diagrams for each high priority task were created to demonstrate how the user will navigate through various pages: Landing, Onboarding, and Home. First sketching, then degital. These flows are crucial to identifying key actions within the app and which screens to focus on first.  At this stage, they’re far from set and stone, but lay a solid foundation.</p>
          <img src="images/flows.png" alt="User flows">

          <p>I then used the research data, user stories, and user flows to create a sitemap in order to organize each destination in the user flows. The sitemap was used as an outline to create the content strategy, which helped me focus on clarity and lay down a solid foundational structure of the project before moving forward.</p>

          <h3>HIGH FIDELITY</h3>
          <p>After tweaking and adjusting, I brought the wireframes to life in Figma by creating high fidelity digital versions of the wireframes for testing purposes in order to identify if there are any complications with the UX.</p>

            <span class="underline">Usability Tests</span>
          </h2>
          <p>I created a clickable prototype of the wireframes in InVision and conducted 3 usability tests, two of which were remote and one in-person. Feedback from this first round of testing was crucial before executing high fidelity designs.<br>I decided to test two Teachers (to align with the target audience) and one Designer (to pick their brain about best practices). User feedback prompted a series of iterations in between each usability test.</p>

            <li><h3>THE LANDING PAGE CAN BE SIMPLIFIED</h3><p>into one page. Only 1 user in this round of testing clicked through the tabs (resources, educators, our team) to view more information.</p></li>

              <span class="underline">Concept & Identity</span>
            </h2>
            <p>The name Open Book came about when thinking of a phrase educators use when giving their students a test. When a test is “Open Book” it means that you are permitted to use any resources available to you to complete the assessment. An open book test requires a lot of preparation and studying beforehand so that you can find the information quickly.<br>Many times this process involves sticking tabs on pages to save important information, which is why Open Book’s logo includes 3 stacked tabs symbolizing preparation and collaboration.</p>

            <h3>COLORS</h3>
            <p>I wanted to achieve a feeling of professionalism, but also wanted the product to feel motivating and friendly, which is why Open Book makes use of  red, light blue, and a dark grey as primary colors. Subtle pops of red represent creativity and activity to make users feel energized and excited about planning engaging lessons for their students.</p>

            <h3>TYPOGRAPHY</h3>
            <p>Montserrat and Open Sans, geometric sans-serif typefaces, are used to create high readability with little distraction.<br>The dark grey font paired with light blue and white elements creates a clean, simplistic atmosphere with a primary purpose - to foster productivity.</p>

              <span class="underline">Preference Testing</span>
            </h2>
            <p>I collected date on three preference tests in regards to the design. This is essential so that I don't rely on my own assumptions, I insteas see what users prefer.<br>With that said, it’s important to take feedback into consideration, but there must be a valid reason to prompt the iteration.</p>

            <h3>RECENT DOCUMENTS</h3>
            <p>The initial design included a list view in order to make the Dashboard more compact. A preference test was given to be sure that this decision aligns with the users’ desires and needs.<br>The layout decisions of the Recent Documents section is confirmed as data shows that users do in fact appreciate the list view over the grid view. User feedback suggests that the list view provides better usability when locating files and folders recently opened.</p>

            <h3>MOBILE NAVIGATION</h3>
            <p>While the original iteration is clean and simple, data insists that users actually prefer the light blue background color of the secondary navigation because it breaks up the navigation. I decided to align the design with the feedback because it will increase the usability and more closely resembles the desktop version.</p>

            <h3>MOBILE NAVIGATION</h3>
            <p>The initial design includes an angled edge that resembles the same shape as the logo tabs, yet rotated 90 degrees. The purpose of this was to add a unique element that played off of the Open Book logo. While this all seems like a clever idea, testing actually proved that users appreciate the straight edge versus angled.<br>Feedback suggests that people care more about the content being clean and visible and not so much about the “unique” design.</p>

            <p>Once the high fidelity mockups were close to completion, I validated the designs by testing 3 more users with my working Invision prototype. A series of touch ups were done until the following goals were met:</p>

            <h3>GOALS</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Design aligns with brand characteristics</li>
              <li>There are no complications in the UX</li>
              <li>The user completes browse, save, and edit task flows with ease</li>

            <h3>A MONUMENTAL STEPPING STONE IN MY CAREER</h3>
            <p>From ideation to completion, Open Book has undergone many changes and iterations. This project started without a target audience, product name, or even a problem in mind, and ended with an established solution. Taking a vague concept and turning it into tangible website on my own for the first time was at times overwhelming, but a great learning experience and monumental to my career as a Designer.</p>

            <h3>NEXT STEPS FOR THIS PROJECT</h3>
            <p>The deliverables are packaged up nicely for the development team, with all of the essential elements exported as both pngs and svgs and organized neatly in separate folders.<br>I would have liked to work more on the animation, but due to a time constraint, I stuck to the project MVP and focused on the solution. If time were free, next steps for this product would begin with adding subtle and effective microinteractions and designing a mobile native app version.</p>

              <span class="underline">What I learned</span>
            </h2>
            <p>Test. Test. Test. This project taught me the emphasis and importance of testing. This process is not about which design I prefer, it’s which one the user prefers and why they prefer it. I can make assumptions, but they need to be tested and proven in order to be valid. Initially, I assumed the home page design could resemble that of Pinterest’s, but users wanted to see a focus on all of the app features, such as files, teams, and activity, not just browsing. So a change to the flow needed to be made in order to align the app with user preferences.<br>Looking back, I spent too much time on early deliverables, specifically digital wireframes. They went through many iterations after testing that could have been prevented with a quick initial paper prototype.</p>
